Remix of a design found on Printables [here](https://www.printables.com/model/380409)

The design is one layer thick and requires a filament change. 

Slicer:
The STL will load as a single object in the face down orientation.
In your slicer of choice, you will need to process by object, select the
hex objects (at the moment there are 7 hex objects) and change their
color to your filament color of choice. 
Slice and print!! 

WIP: A face with no hex outline around the Micron Logo.
